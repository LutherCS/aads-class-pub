## Goals

- Why bother learning advanced algorithms and data structures
- Why bother learning advanced anything
- Why bother learning
- Why bother
- Why

::: notes

Sometimes standard implementation is too rigid or does not fit the needs of a specific problem.
One needs to understand a known data structure or an algorithm in order to use it properly.

## Problem solving

### Basic approach

Almost any problem can be solved using the combination of the following:

- Brute force
- Array
- Infinite time

### See them aliens

### Constrains

- Time
- Processing power
- Storage
- Memory
- Bandwidth

## Algorithms

Algorithms are for people who don't know how to buy RAM.

:::

### Basic algorithms

- Linear search
- Binary search
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Breadth first search
- Depth first search
- Greedy algorithms

### Advanced algorithms

- Quick sort
- Merge sort
- Minimax
- Dynamic programming
- Minimum spanning tree
- Shortest path
- Heuristic search

### Very advanced algorithms

Usually involve a fair amount of math

## Data structures

Algorithms + data structures = programs

--Niklaus Wirth

### Data organization

Data storage optimization needs:

- **C**reate / Insert
- **R**etrieve / Query
- **U**pdate
- **D**elete

### Collection data types

- Tuple
- List
- Set
- Dictionary

::: notes

_lists_ are basic and versatile

_tuples_ are immutable

_sets_ are fast

_dictionaries_ are awesome

:::

### Basic data structures

- Array
- Stack
- Queue
- Deque
- Linked list
- Doubly-linked list
- Circular list
- Doubly-linked circular list

::: notes

_arrays_ are basic and versatile

_stacks_ are used to simulate recursion, process function calls, DFS

_queues_ are used in simulations, BFS

_linked lists_ are fast for insertion and removal

:::

### Advanced data structures

- Set
- Map
- Partition
- Tree
- Heap
- Balanced tree
- Trie
- Graph

::: notes

_heaps_ are also known as _priority queues_ and used in Dijkstra's and other _greedy_ algorithms

_sets_ are used to check membership, find $k$-th largest, items smaller then the given one

_maps_ are used in _dynamic programming_

:::

### Very advanced data structures

- Van Emde Boas tree
- Judy array
- Probabilistic data structures

## Algorithms + data structures = programs

Almost any solution can be _improved_ using the combination of the following:

- Proper algorithm
  - more efficient
  - more specific
  - constraint-aware
- Appropriate data structure
  - more efficient
  - yet feasible

## Human vs machine

- Machine is _stupid_
- Human is _smart_

::: notes

stupid (adj): having or showing a great lack of intelligence or common sense

smart (adj): having or showing a quick-witted intelligence

## Computational complexity

### Asymptotic notation

- Asymptotic _upper_ bound: Big-O
- Asymptotic _lower_ bound: Big-$\Omega$
- Asymptotic _tight_ bound: Big-$\Theta$
- Amortized complexity

### Big-O

$O(g(n)) = \{f(n) | \exists k > 0, n_0 \in Z^+ \ni 0 \le f(n) \le k \times g(n), \forall n \ge n_0\}$

### Big-$\Omega$

$\Omega(g(n)) = \{f(n) | \exists k > 0, n_0 \in Z^+ \ni 0 \le k \times g(n) \le f(n), \forall n \ge n_0\}$

### Big-$\Theta$

$\Theta(g(n)) = {} \{f(n) | \exists k_1, k_2 > 0, n_0 \in Z^+ \ni 0 \le k_1 \times g(n) \le f(n) \le k_2 \times g(n), \forall n \ge n_0\}$

### Why does it matter

Algorithm evaluation and comparison

### Unsolvable (?) mysteries

$P = NP$

$P \ne NP$

### P =? NP

![P =? NP](images/pnp.svg)

::: notes

$P$ - solvable in polynomial time

$NP$ - verifiable in (nondeterministic) polynomial time

$NP-complete$ - set of problems to which other $NP$ can be reduced in polynomial time

$NP-hard$ - at least as hard as any $NP$ but he solution doesn't need to be verifiable
