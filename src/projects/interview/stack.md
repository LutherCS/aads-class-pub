# Insert coin to win a stupid prize

This is a completely artificial project that has no practical application or relevance. It is based on the essay [The Perils of Programming as Puzzle
](https://mcorrell.medium.com/the-perils-of-programming-as-puzzle-67145b4accd) by
Michael Correll. I hope you never see this question outside of the classroom.

## Task

Implement a `stack` data structure using *heap* (Priority Queue) data structure as a basis. For the sake of simplicity use the built-in module `heapq`.

See the class and method descriptions in the `stack.py` for implementation details and requirements. Method `__init__` has been implemented and *cannot* be changed.

## What to do

`python` should be `python3.12` or newer.

- Read *src/projects/interview/stack_description.md* (this file).
- Modify *src/projects/interview/stack.py*.

- Test your implementation.

```bash
python -m pytest tests/projects/interview/test_stack.py
```
